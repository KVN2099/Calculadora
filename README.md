# Calculadora
This simple calculator project was designed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery.

The main purpose of this project was to learn how JavaScript classes and promises work. 
For example, if I instantiate the class `calculadora` with numbers 5 and 0, and call the method `divisionAsincronica()` (asynchronous division), it will return an error because the denominator value is 0.
